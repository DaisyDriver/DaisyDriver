        <p>
            Before operating the DaisyDriver, it is important to familiarise
            yourself with the locations of the important features on the module.
            These are shown below, and numbered when mentioned in the text.
        </p>

            DaisyDriver is composed of modular units, each of which can operate separately
            or as part of a chain, connected by cables. Chained operation is useful to extend
            the number of axes that can be operated simultaneously. <b>When operating modules in
            a chain, it is essential that the chain is not broken or added to whilst the chain
            is powered on, otherwise damage can result to the modules</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            When adding motors to an existing setup, first site the modules at each group of
            motors. Once the modules are secured in place, they can be connected with cables.
            <b>It is important that modules are joined in order, i.e. cables always run from
            the OUT port (6) of one module to the IN port (7) of another.</b> Once the modules
            have been connected in a chain, the start of the chain (the module at one end of
            the chain which outputs to the remainder of the chain) can be connected to a
            computer using a USB A to Micro B cable (1). The power cable can be plugged into
            any of the units (8), though it is often convenient to connect it to the start of
            the chain.
        </p>

        <p>
            When power is applied, all the units in the chain should blink their status
            indicator LED (3) in the sequence Red-Green-Blue. Each unit will then momentarily
            turn its status indicator Red to indicate that it is waiting to be initialised,
            before blinking Green a number of times corresponding to the module's physical
            position in the chain, which is also its logical address.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the chain has been powered on successfully, it is ready to be controlled.
        </p>

        <p>
            DaisyDriver can be controlled in one of two modes: <b>Serial Command</b> or <b>GUI</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Serial Command</b> offers control of a chain of DaisyDrivers through a command
            line interface. More detail is available on the
            <a href="serial.html">Serial Command page.</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The <b>DaisyDriver GUI</b> is a specialised graphic interface for using the DaisyDriver
        with a <a href="https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope/">WaterScope (Openflexure
        Microscope)</a> for time lapse microscopy. More detail is available on the
        <a href="gui.html">GUI page.</a>
