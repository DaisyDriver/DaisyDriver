        <h2>Soldering Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set one hotplate next to the other and ensure the tops are clean
                and free from distortion. Turn one on to 100&#8451;, and the other
                to 350&#8451;. Allow ample time for them to come to temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply solder paste using either a stencil or an applicator syringe.
                A stencil is recommended due to the high accuracy of paste deposition
                it offers, as well as the superior evenness of the applied paste thickness.
                <img class="assemblyimg" src="assets/assembly1.jpg">
            </li>
            <li>
                Place surface mount components on the board, noting that slight errors
                in the positions of the components will generally be corrected by the
                surface tension of the solder at reflow.
                <img class="assemblyimg" src="assets/assembly2.jpg">
            </li>
            <li>
                Wearing the safety gloves and glasses, position the metal plate on
                the 100&#8451; plate, and allow it to come to temperature. Note that
                thermal distortion of the plate may initially occur, which can
                be corrected by pressing down on the corners of the plate with the tweezers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the plate has come to temperature, place the PCB on it and wait
                for up to two minutes for it to heat up. During this time, thermal
                distortions can be corrected by pushing gently on the corners of the
                PCB, in the same manner as step 4. The solder paste may change slightly
                in appearance, and the flux may activate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the PCB has come to temperature on the 100&#8451; metal plate, transfer the PCB
                on the metal plate to the 350&#8451; hotplate. Correct thermal distortions as before,
                and observe the pads of the PCB carefully. The solder paste should begin to melt
                within 2 minutes, and be fully molten within 3. Any pads that do not reflow within
                3 minutes can be corrected by hand using a rework station. Take care also that
                the silkscreen is not scorched before the PCB reflows; if this occurs, then a
                redesign of the board may be necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the PCB and the metal plate back to the 100&#8451; hotplate for approximately
                one minute and then to a wire rack. This step is to avoid thermal shock to the
                components. Once the PCB has cooled to around 50&#8451;, the metal plate can be
                safely extracted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat steps 1-7 with all further PCBs to be soldered, then turn off the hotplates
                and allow them to cool. Wash the PCBs with isopropanol and allow to dry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Solder any remaining through-hole components in by hand.
